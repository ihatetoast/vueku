# Vueku: a haiku maker in Vue

## What
An oh so simple app created with Vue so that I can see what it is I'm learning and what it is I'm just coding along. The user can create a haiku and then change the lines if the generated haiku is not to their liking. 

## Why
Why not? Learning Vue and making a haiku builder entertains me and is my go-to first app when learning something new. Nu? Nue?

## Toolbox
- HTML
- CSS
- VueJS
